You can combine two hex strings of 16 bytes and the result will stay the same length and be reversable.
The most elegant way to do this is with the xor operation, as it is its own inverse.
To recover the original data just run the xor operation again using the result and one of the input files 
to generate the other input file again. This demonstrates the commutative principle pertains to the input
strings, they can be either input string position and the result is still the same.
Also, bitwise and bytewise operation are the same for the xor function.
You must be more careful with the other functions, it makes a vast difference if the operations are 
nibble-wise or byte-wise. Subtraction byte-wise is the most complicated operation, as order matters and 
no carry-over from byte to byte is wanted. Also only positive results are obtained by adding 256 to the result 
before taking modulo 256. There are 256 possible values in one byte of hex.
Select file a and file b, they should each contain 16 bytes of hex on one line with no extra spaces or line returns.
You can reverse the text, combine the text in normal or reverse order either file, and save your displayed result
to a file by selecting the save button.
Each file is saved with the input files as part of the filename and a timestamp and identifier.
You can create a new folder to hold your result if you like.
There is a history display showing the filename and result . 
There are still some bugs in this copy.
The browse dialog window opens when I save a file but it is not populated with a created combined filename.
I still have to make up a name myself which is not what I want. The created filename could be
file1.txt_file2.txt.txt unless the file extensions are removed first so file1_file2-xorTimestampID.txt or similar
format where the Timestamp is in this format "2024-03-14 16:52:58.271488" . It could be abridged to fewer places.
Code for generating timestamp:
````
from datetime import datetime

# Getting the current date and time
dt = datetime.now()

# getting the timestamp
ts = datetime.timestamp(dt)

print("Date and time is:", dt)
print("Timestamp is:", ts)
````
The created filename should be composed of the ORIGINAL filenames, not the field names when selecting files in tkinter.
